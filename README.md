# Unnamed(for now!) 2D Platformer Game  
_A Fun Journey into Learning Pygame!_

---

## üïπÔ∏è About the Game  
This project is a 2D platformer game built from scratch using **Pygame**. It's more than just a game‚Äîit's a learning experience aimed at understanding how game mechanics work, including:  
- Character movement  
- Physics (gravity, jumping, and collisions)  
- Level design  
- Simple animations  

---

## üéØ Learning Goals  
By looking up this project it may help you learn: 
- The fundamentals of **Pygame**, a powerful library for 2D game development.  
- How to handle player inputs, movements, and collisions.  
- Basic concepts of game loops and frame rate control.  
- How to handle animations through .png files.
- General programming principles. For example, there's already a lot of refactoring to be done!

## üöÄ Features  
- **Platformer mechanics**: Jump, run, and explore the level!   
- **Pixel-perfect collisions**: Your character interacts smoothly with the environment.  //toDo
- **Retro graphics**: A GBA-style aesthetic for a nostalgic experience.  
- **Simple design** : This project will only need python + pygame to run / develop. Perfect for newstarters!

**IMPORTANT**: at this point, no assets are uploaded since i don't actually own any. in future updates there will be though.
For now if you want to test it, you will have to add your own assets such as a hero sprite and animations. The code allows 
for fallbacks though, so you can run it without any. Just be prepared for your hero to be a big red rectangle.
